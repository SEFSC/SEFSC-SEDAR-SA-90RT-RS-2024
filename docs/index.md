**Data Workshop Groups**:
  + Effort and Landings
  + Social and Economy
  + Life History
  + Indices
  + Environment and Industry 

**Year range**: YYYY-YYYY (Previous Assessment: YYYY-YYYY) UPDATE

**Conversions**: Parameters of growth and conversions (TL-WW) were treated as input to the assessment model

**Commercial**:  
  + *Boundary*: Statistical grids 1-21, North of US Highway 1 in the Florida Keys and North of the boundary line that extends from Key West to the Dry Tortugas UPDATE
  + *Fleet structure*: (1) Commercial Handline (2) Other gears were pooled with Commercial Handline
  + *Landings units*: Provide commercial landings and discards in pounds and numbers

**Recreational**:  
  + *Boundary*: Gulf of Mexico states from Texas to the Florida Keys at the Dade-Monroe County line UPDATE
  + *Fleet structure*: (1) Headboat (2) Gen Rec (private and charter modes)
  + *Landings units*: Provide recreational landings and discards in pounds and numbers

**Indices**:  
  + *Commercial Handline*: UPDATE
  + *Headboat Index*: UPDATE
  + *Headboat Discards*: UPDATE    
  + *SRFS Vidio Index*: UPDATE
  + *SRFS Chevron Trap*: UPDATE


**Composition Data Input Sample Sizes**: Sample sizes (numbers of trips) of length compositions (len) or agec ompositions (age) by survey or fleet

**Length Bins and Units**: Length compositions for all data sources were developed in 3-cm bins over the range 21–99 cm (labeled at bin center)

**Ages**: As in previous SEDAR assessments, the age-dependent estimates of Ma were rescaled to provide the same fraction of fish surviving from age 4 through the oldest observed age (51 yr) as would occur with constant M = 0.11
